Then, please fork the repo, make whatever edits you feel are necessary, and submit a pull request.

## How to add a new translation

1. Create a new folder in the root directory, using the two-letter language code of the language (e.g., `zh` = Mandarin Chinese).
2. Add two lines to [the language switcher in the template](https://github.com/multilingual-dh/multilingual-dh.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/default.html#L33), with that language code. 
3. Modify [the SASS](https://github.com/multilingual-dh/multilingual-dh.github.io/blob/master/css/style.sass#L68) to include the language code.
