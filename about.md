## Project Introduction
*Around DH 2020* revisits the goals of the original [Around DH in 80 Days](http://arounddh.org), in order to introduce new and veteran audiences to the *global* field of DH scholarly practice by bringing together current DH projects from around the world.

Despite getting off to a slow start at the beginning of the year, *Around DH 2020* aims to feature one DH project from the Global South, and/or in a language other than English, every week. We also hope to include write-ups of "the state of DH" in particular regions, languages, or fields throughout the year.


## Join the Project as an Editor or Translator
Editorial meetings for *Around DH 2020* happen synchronously every other Friday starting February 7th, with discussion between meetings via this mailing list. If you're interested in volunteering to help identify projects and get the information we need to feature them, please join the mailing list and the calls.

We're also looking for translators interested in translating the posts into any other language. Please email Quinn Dombrowski at qad@stanford.edu if you'd like to volunteer! Translators will be credited as co-authors of their translations.



## Editorial Policy
Quinn Dombrowski selected the first few projects, based on linguistic diversity and responsiveness of the project teams. Subsequent choices will be made collectively by the volunteer editors, but the ultimate responsibility for all decisions (and any ire associated with them) lies with Quinn Dombrowski. 

One goal of *Around DH 2020* is to minimize the overlap in project teams between featured projects, and use the "State of DH" pieces to draw larger connections within the field. By the end of the year, we hope to have showcased projects featuring a wide range of languages, locations, and methods.
