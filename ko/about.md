## Project Introduction
*Around DH 2020*는 원래 [Around DH in 80 Days](http://arounddh.elotroalex.com/) 프로젝트의 목표에 대해 재논의하고자 합니다. 또한 전문가 혹은 새로운 청중들에게 디지털 인문학의 글로벌 분야를 알리기 위해, 전세계에 현존하는 DH 프로젝트들과 소통하고자 합니다. *Around DH in 80 Days*는  지구촌에 진행되고 있는 DH 프로젝트의 존재 대한 인식을 제고하는데 앞장 선 선구자입니다. 최근 5년 동안, 이 프로젝트의 존재는 분명해졌습니다. 이제 *Around DH 2020*를 통해서, 우리는 다음 단계로 나가고자 합니다. 예를 들어, 이러한 프로젝트 뒤에 있는 사람들과 소스들, 사용된 툴과, 이 프로젝트들이 *의미*하는 바들, 이러한 전체적인 *연결고리*를 표면화 하고자 합니다. 프로젝트 개발자들은 이 작업과 함께 무엇을 성취하고자 할까요? 이 과정에서 그들은 무엇을 배울까요? To accomplish this, each piece is written by someone associated with the project, responding in their own words to questions posed by *Around DH 2020*.

Despite getting off to a slow start at the beginning of the year, *Around DH 2020* aims to feature one DH project in a language other than English or from a minoritized group, every week. We also hope to include write-ups of "the state of DH" in particular regions, languages, or fields throughout the year.

## Submit a Project
If you know of a project that you would like to see featured in *Around DH 2020*, please [fill out this project form](https://forms.gle/b6EeaCph2bBWREEx8). Submissions will be sent to the editors for consideration.

## Join the Project as an Editor or Translator
Brief editorial meetings for *Around DH 2020* will happen synchronously every other Friday starting March 6th at 9:00 AM Pacific, with discussion between meetings via the [Around DH 2020 mailing list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/around-dh-2020). If you're interested in volunteering to help identify projects and get the information we need to feature them, please [join the mailing list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/around-dh-2020).

We're also looking for translators interested in translating the posts into any other language. Please email Quinn Dombrowski at qad@stanford.edu if you'd like to volunteer! Translators will be credited as co-authors of their translations.


## Editorial Policy
Quinn Dombrowski selected the first few projects, based on linguistic diversity and responsiveness of the project teams. Subsequent choices will be made collectively by the volunteer editors, but the ultimate responsibility for all decisions (and any ire associated with them) lies with Quinn Dombrowski. 

One goal of *Around DH 2020* is to minimize the overlap in project teams between featured projects, and use the "State of DH" pieces to draw larger connections within the field. By the end of the year, we hope to have showcased projects featuring a wide range of languages, locations, and methods.


## Acknowledgements
